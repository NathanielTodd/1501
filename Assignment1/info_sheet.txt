Additional comments to the grader: Answers to Questions: My machine idles at ~1gb RAM usage. 
							 When running my program uses ~1.5gb RAM (out of 4 gb)

							I did not address the issues of memory usage but I imagine
							to better manage memory we could write out the DLBtrie object
							to a file in order to save space and time when reading it in.
